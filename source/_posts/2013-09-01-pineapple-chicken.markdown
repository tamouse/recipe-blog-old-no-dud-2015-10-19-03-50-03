<div class="excerpt">
Recipe from an ad in the local coupon circular, a tasty and spicy way to make chicken.
</div>

## Ingredients
* 1/4 cup Heinz 57 sauce
* 1/4 cup water
* 1 8oz. can crushed pineapple, with juice
* 3 tablespoons brown sugar
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts

## Directions

1. In a small bowl, combine Heinz 57 sauce, water, crushed pineapple with juice, and brown sugar. Set aside.

2. In a large skillet, heat olive oil. Add chicken to pan and cook over medium heat for 8 minutes each side, or until cooked through to an internal temperature of 165 &deg;F.

3. Add sauce to pan and simmer for 5 minutes.

Serve with rice.

## Comments

Since one of the people I cook for abhors olive oil, I just spray the
skillet with PAM.

Instead of cooking the chicken breasts whole, I cube them so they cook
evenly and make a nicer serving.

Substitute a white wine for the water.
