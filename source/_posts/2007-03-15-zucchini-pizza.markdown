A pizza crust made with zucchini instead of dough. This should be celiac-friendly (gluten-free).

## Ingredients

* 5 cups shredded zucchini
* 1 cup shredded mozaarella 
* 1 cup shredded Cheddar sheese
* 2 eggs, beaten
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 12 ounces tomato sauce
* 2 teaspoon oregano
* 1 bell pepper, chopped
* 1/4 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
* 1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese
* Fresh tomato slices 

## Directions

Squeeze out moisture from zucchini. Must get all moisture out or crust
will be watery. I let the shredded zucchini drain in a colander for
about an hour pressing the water out until very dry. *(Can add salt
to the zucchini to extract the moisture faster)*

Mix the shredded zucchini with 1/2 cup of each of the cheeses and
eggs. Press mixture into greased jelly roll pan to form the
crust. Bake at 400 degrees for 8-10 minutes.

Top the crust with the remaining ingredients. Bake 10-15 minutes more
or until hot and bubbly. Very Good!
