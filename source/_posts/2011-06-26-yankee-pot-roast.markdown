We call this "Red Kettle" pot roast because we cook it in a red dutch oven :-) 

## Ingredients

* 1 onion, chopped
* Beef Chuck Roast, about 3 pounds
* 1/2 package dry onion soup mix
* 1 cup water or red wine
* 6 medium potatoes, cut up into bite-sized pieces (skinned or not, as you prefer)
* 1 cup carrots, peeled and cut up into bite-sized pieces

## Directions

1. Chop an onion.

2. In the pot, heat some butter or oil and saut&eacute; the onion until just translucent.

3. Sear the roast on all sides in the pot.

4. Add the liquid to the pot and roast at 300{$DegF} for 2.5 to 3 hours.

5. After an hour or so, cut up the other vegetables and add to the pot. Cook for the remaining time.

6. Serve it forth!

## Variations

* Instead of onion soup mix, use a can of french onion soup (undiluted) and half the other liquid

* Other types of potatoes, such as sweet potatoes, yams, etc, go well in this
