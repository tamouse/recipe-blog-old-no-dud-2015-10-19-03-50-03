<div class="excerpt">
Gratins get a bad rap—but they’re actually the ultimate weeknight
casserole. Most people imagine that gratins are flooded with cream and
cheese, though neither is essential to a good one. I call this gratin
“baked wild rice” to avoid the misconception. It’s made with a wild rice
blend, onions cooked until they’re sweet, ribbons of kale, and grated
cheese. The result is one of our favorite cold-weather dishes, decadent
but not over the top. I often make it at the start of the week, then
reheat it throughout—either as a side dish or as a meal in itself,
especially with a soft-boiled egg on top.

Gratins get a bad rap—but they’re actually the ultimate weeknight
casserole. Most people imagine that gratins are flooded with cream and
cheese, though neither is essential to a good one. I call this gratin
“baked wild rice” to avoid the misconception. It’s made with a wild rice
blend, onions cooked until they’re sweet, ribbons of kale, and grated
cheese. The result is one of our favorite cold-weather dishes, decadent
but not over the top. I often make it at the start of the week, then
reheat it throughout—either as a side dish or as a meal in itself,
especially with a soft-boiled egg on top.

- Serves: 8
- Active Time: 50 min.
- Total Time: 1 hr. 20 min.

## Ingredients

-   3 Tbsp unsalted ૛utter, divided
-   1 Tbsp olive oil
-   2 large sweet onions, halved and sliced
-   Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
-   4 cups stemmed ­ribboned kale leaves
-   5 cups cooked wild rice blend
-   2 cups (8 oz) grated Swiss cheese, divided
-   ¾ cup chicken broth
-   1 cup dry bread crumbs
-   8 large eggs (optional)

## Directions

1.  Preheat oven to 375°F.

2.  Caramelize onions: Melt 1 Tbsp butter in oil in a large skillet over
    medium-low heat; add onions and season with ½ tsp salt and a little
    pepper; cook until onions are tender and sweet, stirring
    occasionally, about 30 minutes. Add kale and let wilt, about 5
    minutes. Combine onion-kale mixture, wild rice, and 1 cup grated
    cheese in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper, if needed.

3.  Assemble and bake: Grease a 2-quart baking dish with 1 Tbsp butter.
    Spread wild rice mixture into dish and pour broth over. Top with
    remaining 1 cup cheese. Melt remaining 1 Tbsp butter; toss with
    bread crumbs. Sprinkle over cheese. Bake until bubbly and brown on
    top, 30 to 35 minutes.

4.  If serving with eggs, bring a pot of water to boil. Add eggs and
    cook 5 to 6 minutes (for soft-boiled). Peel eggs under cool running
    water. Serve each portion with an egg. Add salt and pepper.
