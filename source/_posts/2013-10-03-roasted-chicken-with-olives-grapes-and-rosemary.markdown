The first time I made this, I was unwaveringly certain that nobody would
like it. My husband detests sweet things in savory dishes; I find most
olives too salty; and the toddler, well, he’s a toddler. You’re probably
wondering why I went ahead anyway. The thing is, I think browning and
oven-roasting chicken, then making a sauce from the pan drippings, is
one of the greatest ways to cook a bird. It’s quick, so it totally
passes muster on a weeknight. It’s not expensive. And because the
chicken is cooked in pieces, it can accommodate an assortment of picky
eaters—say, a husband who likes only white meat, a wife who likes only
dark meat, and a child who insists he doesn’t like chicken as he chews
on a drumstick. Despite my pessimism, we were blown away by this dish. I
have made it with ingredients both highbrow (local grapes and imported
olives) and low (street-cart grapes and sad olives from the back of the
fridge) and have never found it less than perfect.

The first time I made this, I was unwaveringly certain that nobody would
like it. My husband detests sweet things in savory dishes; I find most
olives too salty; and the toddler, well, he’s a toddler. You’re probably
wondering why I went ahead anyway. The thing is, I think browning and
oven-roasting chicken, then making a sauce from the pan drippings, is
one of the greatest ways to cook a bird. It’s quick, so it totally
passes muster on a weeknight. It’s not expensive. And because the
chicken is cooked in pieces, it can accommodate an assortment of picky
eaters—say, a husband who likes only white meat, a wife who likes only
dark meat, and a child who insists he doesn’t like chicken as he chews
on a drumstick. Despite my pessimism, we were blown away by this dish. I
have made it with ingredients both highbrow (local grapes and imported
olives) and low (street-cart grapes and sad olives from the back of the
fridge) and have never found it less than perfect.

- Serves: 6
- Active Time: 25 min.
- Total Time: 45 min.

## Ingredients

-   3 lb bone-in skin-on chicken parts (thighs, drumsticks, and/or
    breasts)
-   Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
-   1 Tbsp olive oil
-   1 cup seedless grapes
-   1 cup pitted kalamata olives
-   2 shallots, sliced
-   1 Tbsp chopped fresh rosemary
-   ½ cup dry white wine
-   ½ cup chicken broth

## Directions

1.  Preheat oven to 450°F.

2.  Pat chicken dry and season generously with salt and pepper. Warm oil
    in a heavy, ovenproof 12-inch skillet (cast- iron if you’ve got it)
    over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Working in 2 batches, brown
    chicken, flipping once, about 5 minutes per batch, transferring
    first batch to a plate while second batch browns. I take a lot of
    care in this step, not moving chicken until skin releases itself and
    is nicely bronzed.

3.  Return all chicken to pan, skin side up, and surround with grapes,
    olives, shallots, and rosemary. Roast chicken until just cooked
    through and juices run clear, about 20 minutes. 4. Transfer chicken,
    grapes, and olives to a platter, then add wine and chicken broth to
    juices in skillet over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, scraping
    up any brown bits, and cook until reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes.
    Strain sauce and pour over chicken, if desired. (See how long it
    takes guests to offer to slurp up sauce with a spoon.)
