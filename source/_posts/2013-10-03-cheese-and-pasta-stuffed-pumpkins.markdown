Oh My Gourd: Cheesy Pasta Stuffed Pumpkins
==========================================

## Ingredients

-   2 (4-lb) sugar pumpkins or kabocha or red kuri squash
-   Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
-   1 (4-oz) package diced pancetta
-   ½ sweet onion, diced
-   3½ cups dried elbow pasta
-   1 (10-oz) box frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
-   ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese
-   ¼ lb grated Gruyère cheese
-   1 cup heavy cream

## Directions

1.  Preheat oven to 375°F. Cut an opening in top of each pumpkin or
    squash; remove and reserve tops; scrape out seeds and season insides
    with salt.

2.  Cook pancetta in a medium skillet over medium-high heat until crisp,
    about 4 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to
    drain. Add onion to skillet, season with salt, and cook until
    softened, about 5 minutes.

3.  Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook pasta 2
    minutes less than package directs (about 8 minutes). Drain.

4.  Combine pancetta, onion, pasta, spinach, Parmesan, and Gruyère in a
    bowl. Add salt and pepper. Divide pasta mixture between pumpkins,
    packing tightly. Pour ½ cup cream over pasta in each pumpkin. Set
    tops in place.

5.  Bake pumpkins on a rimmed baking sheet until flesh is easily pierced
    with a knife, about 1 hour, 30 minutes. Serve pasta from pumpkins,
    scooping out some pumpkin flesh with each helping.

## Cook's Note

You can use just about any round winter squash for this recipe. But
steer clear of the field pumpkins meant for jack-o’-lanterns: Their
flesh is stringy and less tasty than other varieties.
