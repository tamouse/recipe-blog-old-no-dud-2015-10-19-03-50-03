# Recipe File

Last update: {{ page.path | prepend: "/" | prepend: site.source | file_date | date_to_string }}


Way back when, I had a paper notebook that I used to write all my
recipes down in. At one point I thought for sure I had lost it,
but *no!* my lovely sister found it while we were pawing
through boxes in my storage lockers.

Nevertheless, I had started this file several years ago on old
wiki, and brought them over here in Jekyll and Bootstrap to update
them and add to them.
