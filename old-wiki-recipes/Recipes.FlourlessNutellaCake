Yes, it&rsquo;s only 2 ingredients. And I mean really two ingredients. Not one of those recipes that say two or three ingredients and then one of the ingredients is something like &ldquo;pre-made dough&rdquo; or &ldquo;cake mix.&rdquo; (Not that there is anything wrong with those recipes.) \\%0ahttps://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jzJEAHxchwY/T2wbW6hzNbI/AAAAAAABY90/f9guRRSGTxM/s800/flourless-nutella-cake-8.jpg \\%0aAll you need is Nutella and eggs. That&rsquo;s it. (Okay I guess technically Nutella may be considered more than one ingredient since it&rsquo;s a spread with multiple things. But I don&rsquo;t think of it the same as something like cake mix as an ingredient.) \\%0ahttps://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WpyouPeKar0/T2wcRxKDRaI/AAAAAAABY_g/S7vRiVO1oE8/s800/flourless-nutella-cake-15.jpg \\%0aWith only two ingredients, it&rsquo;s so simple to make.%0a%0aAnd the taste? The taste is divine. Rich, decadent. I didn&rsquo;t think I could make a cake with only two ingredients.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s possible. \\%0ahttps://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ENVbQXaqfgc/T2wdKYx4ILI/AAAAAAABZAY/MiH8Dbbzjbo/s800/flourless-nutella-cake-19.jpg \\%0aI haven&rsquo;t been this excited about a recipe since I made my [[http://kirbiecravings.com/2011/03/fried-bacon-eggs.html | bacon fried eggs]] or my [[http://kirbiecravings.com/2011/06/nutella-lava-cookies.html | nutella lava cookies]]. I hope you love this as much as I do. It&rsquo;s my new favorite recipe. The batter takes less than 10 minutes to make. The cake bakes for 25 minutes. FH and I both loved this cake. It&rsquo;s so good I already made it twice this week! (You know, just to make sure the first one wasn&rsquo;t a fluke.)%0a%0aFor more Nutella recipes, you can check out my collection [[http://kirbiecravings.com/category/recipes/nutella-recipes | here]].%0a%0aNotes: So there&rsquo;s been a lot of comments on this post and while many people have made it successfully, there have been a few people who complain their cake tastes &ldquo;eggy&rdquo; or it didn&rsquo;t work. You have to follow the recipe exactly and you have to make sure you whip the eggs enough and use enough Nutella. With only 2 ingredients, it is easy to make but if you try to simplify the steps, you likely will end up with a poor result.%0a%0a* The key to the texture of the cake and to not end up with something &ldquo;eggy&rdquo; is the whipped eggs which are whipped until triple the volume. This creates the cake texture and it should not end up just tasting like sweetened eggs because the eggs have so much air whipped into them. So it&rsquo;s important to whip the eggs long enough with a stand mixer. I don&rsquo;t know if a hand mixer is powerful enough.%0a%0a* In addition, when you fold in the eggs and Nutella together, it needs to be done in small batches and not all at once or you risk deflating most of the egg meringue you&rsquo;ve made.%0a%0a* Finally, make sure to weigh out the Nutella, and make sure you get all that Nutella into the actual cake as I know it can be sticky and often people leave a lot of the Nutella behind in their measuring cup.%0a%0a->[[http://kirbiecravings.com/2012/03/2-ingredient-flourless-nutella-cake.html/print/ | http://kirbiecravings.com/wp-content/themes/kirbiescravings/images/print.png]]http://kirbiecravings.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/flourless-nutella-cake-34-130x130.jpg !! Two Ingredient Flourless Nutella cake'''Prep Time:''' 10 mins'''Cook Time:''' 25 mins'''Total Time:''' 35 mins!!! Ingredients:4 large or extra large eggs \\%0a8 1/2 ounces Nutella (weigh this out on a scale)!!! Directions:1. Grease a 6 or 7 inch round springform pan. Then line with parchment paper on sides and on bottom. (One of the cakes I made, I simply sprayed pan but it still sticks, so it is best to line with parchment paper. By spraying with oil first, the parchment paper stick ons better.) Preheat oven to 350F. Beat eggs on highest speed with stand mixer until about triple in volume, about 6 minutes. The egg consistency is the key to making this recipe work, so don't try to save time on this step. Eggs must be beaten until triple in volume as that is what creates the cake. \\%0a2. Measure out Nutella into a glass bowl. Microwave Nutella for about 20 seconds to make it softer. Add in 1/3 of the egg mixture. Gently stir with a spatula in the same clockwise direction until all of the egg is mixed in and no streaks remain. Then add another 1/3 of egg mixture and fold again until no egg streaks remain. Pour in remaining third and make sure to scrape the foam that sticks to the mixing bowl into the batter and stir until no streaks remain. Make sure to do this in 3 batches because otherwise the whipped eggs may lose too much of the air that has been whipped into them if you try to do it all at once. \\%0a3. Pour batter into springfoam pan. Bake for 20-25 minutes until knife inserted comes out clean. Let cake cool ''completely'' before removing from pan and cutting and serving.%0a%0a Posted by Kirbie on March 23, 2012 [[http://kirbiecravings.com/2012/03/2-ingredient-flourless-nutella-cake.html#comments | 152 Comments &raquo;]]tags: [[http://kirbiecravings.com:80/tag/cake | cake]], [[http://kirbiecravings.com:80/tag/flourless | flourless]], [[http://kirbiecravings.com:80/tag/nutella | nutella]], [[http://kirbiecravings.com:80/tag/two-ingredient | two ingredient]]         &nbsp;%0a%0a!!!

I&rsquo;m thinking either you didn&rsquo;t beat the eggs enough (perhaps your mixer isn&rsquo;t strong enough or you need to turn it to a higher setting or beat longer?) which would cause it to collapse, or maybe you added too much Nutella. The Nutella needs to be weighed out on a scale. Also you want to make sure when you are mixing it that no streaks of egg remain.

It is possible that aside from not whisking the eggs enough, perhaps too much of the egg was mixed in with the hot nutella, causing the eggs to cook prematurely.

But for those of you allergic to hazelnuts it would be an idea. T.J&rsquo;s e-mailed me and said that it contains no gluten ingredients, not prepared on shared lines but in facility that has wheat. so for those of us gluten intolerant, it is a personal decision as to whether to use it.

I also measured the &lsquo;business&rsquo; out of the Nutella (3/4 cup) which I put into a see-through glass measuring cup and microwaved until it was liquid enough to make absolutely certain that it was 3/4 of a cup. Then I added the + 1 TBSP. All of this has been sitting out for a couple of hours. And, simply because where I nanny (we&rsquo;re making this for the dad&rsquo;s birthday) only has either one VERY large Springform, or two very little ones, we&rsquo;re going with the two little ones, and then putting them together with a wee bit of buttercream-coconut frosting in between. Hopefully, there will be enough for me to taste tomorrow so I can tell you how it went!%0a** http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c49b10955e8aa7b4a75dc2c6d03d0ca4?s=32&d=http://kirbiecravings.com/wp-content/themes/kirbiescravings/images/gravatar.png?s=32&r=G'''Kirbie''' replied: &mdash; December 11th, 2012 @ 4:17 pmI hope your cake turns out!%0a# 64http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/39464b803b78e3a76f78c55bf6327bb7?s=32&d=http://kirbiecravings.com/wp-content/themes/kirbiescravings/images/gravatar.png?s=32&r=G'''ash''' &mdash; December 12, 2012 @ [[http://kirbiecravings.com:80/#comment-144906 | 12:25 pm]]Okay, here are my results. 1: ended up using the bigger pan once I saw the HUGENESS of the fluffy eggs, which of course dial themselves down a bunch one you start mixing in the Nutella. \\%0a2: my cake was ugly due to my ineptness with the parchment paper. \\%0a3: I agree with whomever said above that waiting until the cake is completely cool (at the very least) is the first time it should be tried. It did seem quite eggy yesterday, but today much less so. Also, the consistency of the cake matches the picture more today. \\%0a4: I wonder if high altitude has anything to do with anything \\%0a5: I wonder what would happen if I mixed the nutella in with the eggs using the beater on the lowest setting (which still seems sort of rough). Neither #4 or #5 have anything really to do with anything, I think the cake turned out fine. AND probably was really good with the almond/buttermilk/coconut frosting I made, however it got left out over night and that frightened me.Thanks for the fun!%0a** http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c49b10955e8aa7b4a75dc2c6d03d0ca4?s=32&d=http://kirbiecravings.com/wp-content/themes/kirbiescravings/images/gravatar.png?s=32&r=G'''Kirbie''' replied: &mdash; December 12th, 2012 @ 1:33 pmI think high altitude will effect it, but I don&rsquo;t know by how much.

The technique is fantastic &ndash; whipping whole eggs; yay! I got good volume and didn&rsquo;t deflate it much stirring in the (perfectly measured and prewarmed) Nutella. \\%0aThe cake baked up perfectly (looks exactly like the pic) but honestly, sadly, the flavour was not fantastic. As a previous reviewer said, the Nutella doesn&rsquo;t really shine through as richly as it perhaps could have. Maybe it needs a ground-hazelnut &ldquo;kick&rdquo;? It&rsquo;s a fine, easy cake, but not exactly decadent the way good brownies or fudge is &ndash; and it can&rsquo;t beat a spoonful of Nutella. http://kirbiecravings.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif \\%0aWill definitely keep this in mind for the Passover season when we don&rsquo;t use flour, as it is a fabulous technique!%0a** http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c49b10955e8aa7b4a75dc2c6d03d0ca4?s=32&d=http://kirbiecravings.com/wp-content/themes/kirbiescravings/images/gravatar.png?s=32&r=G'''Kirbie''' replied: &mdash; December 15th, 2012 @ 11:21 pmHmm, I always thought the Nutella shines through pretty well.

Yes, it&rsquo;s only 2 ingredients. And I mean really two ingredients. Not one of those recipes that say two or three ingredients and then one of the ingredients is something like &ldquo;pre-made dough&rdquo; or &ldquo;cake mix.&rdquo; (Not that there is anything wrong with those recipes.) \\%0a%3c https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jzJEAHxchwY/T2wbW6hzNbI/AAAAAAABY90/f9guRRSGTxM/s800/flourless-nutella-cake-8.jpg \\%0a%3c All you need is Nutella and eggs. That&rsquo;s it. (Okay I guess technically Nutella may be considered more than one ingredient since it&rsquo;s a spread with multiple things. But I don&rsquo;t think of it the same as something like cake mix as an ingredient.) \\%0a%3c https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WpyouPeKar0/T2wcRxKDRaI/AAAAAAABY_g/S7vRiVO1oE8/s800/flourless-nutella-cake-15.jpg \\%0a%3c With only two ingredients, it&rsquo;s so simple to make.%0a%3c %0a%3c And the taste? The taste is divine. Rich, decadent. I didn&rsquo;t think I could make a cake with only two ingredients.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s possible. \\%0a%3c https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ENVbQXaqfgc/T2wdKYx4ILI/AAAAAAABZAY/MiH8Dbbzjbo/s800/flourless-nutella-cake-19.jpg \\%0a%3c I haven&rsquo;t been this excited about a recipe since I made my [[http://kirbiecravings.com/2011/03/fried-bacon-eggs.html | bacon fried eggs]] or my [[http://kirbiecravings.com/2011/06/nutella-lava-cookies.html | nutella lava cookies]]. I hope you love this as much as I do. It&rsquo;s my new favorite recipe. The batter takes less than 10 minutes to make. The cake bakes for 25 minutes. FH and I both loved this cake. It&rsquo;s so good I already made it twice this week! (You know, just to make sure the first one wasn&rsquo;t a fluke.)%0a%3c %0a%3c For more Nutella recipes, you can check out my collection [[http://kirbiecravings.com/category/recipes/nutella-recipes | here]].%0a%3c %0a%3c Notes: So there&rsquo;s been a lot of comments on this post and while many people have made it successfully, there have been a few people who complain their cake tastes &ldquo;eggy&rdquo; or it didn&rsquo;t work. You have to follow the recipe exactly and you have to make sure you whip the eggs enough and use enough Nutella. With only 2 ingredients, it is easy to make but if you try to simplify the steps, you likely will end up with a poor result.%0a%3c %0a%3c * The key to the texture of the cake and to not end up with something &ldquo;eggy&rdquo; is the whipped eggs which are whipped until triple the volume. This creates the cake texture and it should not end up just tasting like sweetened eggs because the eggs have so much air whipped into them. So it&rsquo;s important to whip the eggs long enough with a stand mixer. I don&rsquo;t know if a hand mixer is powerful enough.%0a%3c %0a%3c * In addition, when you fold in the eggs and Nutella together, it needs to be done in small batches and not all at once or you risk deflating most of the egg meringue you&rsquo;ve made.%0a%3c %0a%3c * Finally, make sure to weigh out the Nutella, and make sure you get all that Nutella into the actual cake as I know it can be sticky and often people leave a lot of the Nutella behind in their measuring cup.%0a%3c %0a%3c ->[[http://kirbiecravings.com/2012/03/2-ingredient-flourless-nutella-cake.html/print/ | http://kirbiecravings.com/wp-content/themes/kirbiescravings/images/print.png]]http://kirbiecravings.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/flourless-nutella-cake-34-130x130.jpg !! Two Ingredient Flourless Nutella cake'''Prep Time:''' 10 mins'''Cook Time:''' 25 mins'''Total Time:''' 35 mins!!! Ingredients:4 large or extra large eggs \\%0a%3c 8 1/2 ounces Nutella (weigh this out on a scale)!!! Directions:1. Grease a 6 or 7 inch round springform pan. Then line with parchment paper on sides and on bottom. (One of the cakes I made, I simply sprayed pan but it still sticks, so it is best to line with parchment paper. By spraying with oil first, the parchment paper stick ons better.) Preheat oven to 350F. Beat eggs on highest speed with stand mixer until about triple in volume, about 6 minutes. The egg consistency is the key to making this recipe work, so don't try to save time on this step. Eggs must be beaten until triple in volume as that is what creates the cake. \\%0a%3c 2. Measure out Nutella into a glass bowl. Microwave Nutella for about 20 seconds to make it softer. Add in 1/3 of the egg mixture. Gently stir with a spatula in the same clockwise direction until all of the egg is mixed in and no streaks remain. Then add another 1/3 of egg mixture and fold again until no egg streaks remain. Pour in remaining third and make sure to scrape the foam that sticks to the mixing bowl into the batter and stir until no streaks remain.

I&rsquo;m thinking either you didn&rsquo;t beat the eggs enough (perhaps your mixer isn&rsquo;t strong enough or you need to turn it to a higher setting or beat longer?) which would cause it to collapse, or maybe you added too much Nutella. The Nutella needs to be weighed out on a scale. Also you want to make sure when you are mixing it that no streaks of egg remain. Hope this helps!%0a%3c # 24http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/17ab21e485189fe8c53d997675ceaeaf?s=32&d=http://kirbiecravings.com/wp-content/themes/kirbiescravings/images/gravatar.png?s=32&r=G'''Chris''' &mdash; June 27, 2012 @ [[http://kirbiecravings.com:80/#comment-54607 | 10:56 pm]]Kirbie, \\%0a%3c do you think it would be possible to hand mix the eggs to that consistency?%0a%3c ** http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c49b10955e8aa7b4a75dc2c6d03d0ca4?s=32&d=http://kirbiecravings.com/wp-content/themes/kirbiescravings/images/gravatar.png?s=32&r=G'''Kirbie''' replied: &mdash; June 28th, 2012 @ 12:15 amI think it would be really really hard, though not impossible.

I&rsquo;m having a dinner guest tomorrow night, and with all that I&rsquo;m cooking, this will be a quick, easy dessert.Oh! also, I was reading some of the negative feedback, and I think I know why it might taste like an omelette. It is possible that aside from not whisking the eggs enough, perhaps too much of the egg was mixed in with the hot nutella, causing the eggs to cook prematurely. That would likely cause an omelette taste. Do you think maybe it would be a good idea to mix in a small amount of the warm nutella into the raw egg first to temper them, and then pour the tempered egg mixture into the the nutella, 1/3rd by 1/3rd?

T.J&rsquo;s e-mailed me and said that it contains no gluten ingredients, not prepared on shared lines but in facility that has wheat. so for those of us gluten intolerant, it is a personal decision as to whether to use it.

It&rsquo;s a fine, easy cake, but not exactly decadent the way good brownies or fudge is &ndash; and it can&rsquo;t beat a spoonful of Nutella. http://kirbiecravings.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif \\%0a%3c Will definitely keep this in mind for the Passover season when we don&rsquo;t use flour, as it is a fabulous technique!%0a%3c ** http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c49b10955e8aa7b4a75dc2c6d03d0ca4?s=32&d=http://kirbiecravings.com/wp-content/themes/kirbiescravings/images/gravatar.png?s=32&r=G'''Kirbie''' replied: &mdash; December 15th, 2012 @ 11:21 pmHmm, I always thought the Nutella shines through pretty well.

You basically take a spatula and you mix in the same direction (usually clockwise for me). You sort of lift some of the batter up, then mix it with the rest, but rather than just stirring, it is more of a folding gesture. You can take a look at this video, at 1 min 46 seconds in, this person shows how to fold for macarons.
