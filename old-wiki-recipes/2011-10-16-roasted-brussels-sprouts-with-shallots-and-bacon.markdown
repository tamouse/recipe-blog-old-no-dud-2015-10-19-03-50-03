This dish goes great alongside DijonChicken. Instead of using a casserole dish, line a 9x13 inch baking pan with foil and spread the sprout mixture over about 2/3rds of the pan and bake at 350 for 20 minutes or so (enough time to get the chicken ready), then arrange the chicken in the other 1/3rd and lower the temp to 350 and bake an additional 30 minutes.
