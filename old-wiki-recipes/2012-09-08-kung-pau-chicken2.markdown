# Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the skillet/wok. Add the garlic, ginger, scallion whites and pre-cut vegetables; stir-fry until the vegetables are crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.

# Add the chicken and peanuts to the vegetables and stir-fry until the chicken is cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes.

# Stir up the soy-chili sauce mixture, add to skillet/wok and cook until the sauce thickens, about 30 seconds.
