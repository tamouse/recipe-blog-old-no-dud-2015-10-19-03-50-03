[[#ingredients]]
!!Ingredients
* &frac13; cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
* 12 ounces cooked chicken apple sausage, cut into &frac12;-inch pieces
* 4 cups cubed peeled butternut squash (1 small to medium squash)
* 3 medium carrots, chopped
* 1 stalk celery, chopped
* &frac12; medium onion, chopped
* 2&frac12; cups low-sodium chicken broth
* salt and pepper
* &frac12; cup fresh sage or parsley leaves

[[#directions]]
!!Directions

# Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.

# Add the sausage and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl with a slotted spoon.

# Add the squash, carrots, celery, onion, broth, 2&frac12; cups water and &frac34; teaspoon salt to the pot. Cover and bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low and continue simmering until the vegetables are tender, about 15 more minutes.

# Puree the soup in a blender in batches, then return to the pot along with the sausage. Season with salt and pepper and keep warm.

# Heat the remaining &frac12; cup olive oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. When oil if very hot, add the sage leaves in batches and fry, turning, until dark green and crisp, about 1 minute. Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

# To serve, ladle the soup into bowls and top with the fried sage.
