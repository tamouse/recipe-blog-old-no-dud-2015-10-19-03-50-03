Sushi Roll Salad%0a%0aJune 11, 2012%0a%0aI love '''sushi''', so I was naturally drawn to a '''Gourmet''' recipe on '''epicurious''' for [[http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/-California-Roll-Salad-12246 | "California Roll" Salad]]. I made a few changes and came up with this '''Sushi Roll Salad''' to take to a potluck party.%0a%0aThe original recipe uses long grain rice. I used a Japanese brand of '''medium grain ''(sushi)'' rice''' because I thought it would be more authentic. It was very good, and it ''is'' the rice used in sushi, but I think I would use long grain rice next time. The texture of long grain rice might be a bit better in a salad. Many of the reviewers ''raved ''about their results with '''Jasmine rice''', so that may be the way to go.%0a%0a'''California Rolls''' typically are made with '''cucumber''', '''avocado''', and '''surimi'''. Surimi is also known as "imitation crab", "mock crab", or sometimes "Krab". It's made from white fish, often pollock, and quite a list of additives to make an inexpensive substitute for crab. The Gourmet recipe included the option of adding surimi to the salad, but pointed out that the recipe can be successfully made without the surimi for a vegetarian version.%0a%0aI thought about making a vegetarian version since I don't like using surimi, but I liked the idea of using some kind of seafood. I chose '''fresh Oregon shrimp meat''' and I think it worked really well!%0a%0aI used 50%25 more wasabi and ginger juice in the dressing, and I'm glad I did. As one who likes the spicy Maki rolls, I thought it was mild but the flavors were still distinct. A couple of people told me that they liked the fact that it wasn't "too spicy". If I make it again for a party, I will probably make it with the same dressing, but have some extra wasabi and ginger on the side for people to add to their servings if they like it spicier.%0a%0aDespite the fact that I would try a different type of rice next time, I ''really'' liked this '''Sushi Roll Salad'''. Several people at the party told me how much they enjoyed it.%0a%0aBob, my ever-willing in-house taste tester, said he didn't think it was good enough to be "blog-worthy". I disagreed, suggesting that perhaps he felt that way because he's not that crazy about sushi. He admitted that his indifference towards sushi could have influenced his opinion.
