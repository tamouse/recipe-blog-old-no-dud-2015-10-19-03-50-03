This is a pretty standard recipe, nothing really special going on here, but split pea soup is one of those wonderful wintery soups. Thick, delicious, and heartwarming.

[[#ingredients]]
!!Ingredients
* 8 cups stock (HomeMadeStock is great for this.)
* 1 small cooked ham, diced
* 32 ounce package dry split peas
* 3 to 4 large carrots, peeled, sliced
* 2 to 3 stalks celery, cleaned, diced
* 2 medium onions, peeled, diced
* salt and pepper to taste (ham may have some salt, so be careful not to over-salt)

The first time I made this, I used a couple of smoked ham hocks and made the broth from that (see HomeMadeStock). While this made great broth, I would not generally recommend using ham hocks in the soup, though, as there is a considerable amount of fat on a ham hock, and we were left with hardly any meat for the soup.
