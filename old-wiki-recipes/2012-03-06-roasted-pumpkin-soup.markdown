(:comment a few notes about the recipe are sometimes nice:)

The SpicedPecans make this a most interesting soup. Makes 6 1-1/3 cup servings.

[[#directions]]
!!Directions
(:comment ordered list of steps to follow:)
# Heat oven to 375{$DegF}.
# Line roasting pan with foil.
# Place carrots, onion and garlic in pan.
# Drizzle with olive oil and toss until coated.[^Actually, this is a lot easier if you put the vegetables and oil in a zip-lock bag and shake.^]
# Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
# Add pumpkin quarters to pan.
# Spread one tablespoon of brown sugar on each pumpkin quarter. [^I think the brown sugar can safely be omitted.^]
# Top with sage leaves.
# Drizzle with olive oil.
# Roast vegetables 45 to 60 minutes, or until pumpkin flesh is soft.

# Meanwhile, in a 4-quart Dutch Oven bring broth just to boiling and remove from heat.
# Set aside to cool slightly.

# Remove vegetables from oven.
# Discard sage leaves.
# Scoop pumpkin flesh into a medium bowl (there should be about 5 cups).
# In batches, add vegetables and pumpkin to blender or food processor; blend or process until smooth, adding enough cooled broth to reach desired level of consistency.

# To serve, divide soup evenly among six cups or bowls.
# Top with SpicedAlmonds and cilantro.
