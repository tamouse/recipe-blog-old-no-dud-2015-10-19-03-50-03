[[#ingredients]]
!!Ingredients
!!! For the bars
* 1.5 cups broken pretzel pieces
* 1.25 cups all-purpose flour
* 1.5 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 stick unsalted butter
* 1.5 cups packed light brown sugar
* 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

!!! For the topping
* 8 marshmallows, halved crosswise
* 0.25 cup peanut butter chips
* 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, halved
* 0.25 cup semisweet chocolate chips

[[#directions]]
!!Directions
# Position rack in the middle of oven and heat to 350{$DegF}.
# Line a 9-inch square baking pan with aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on all sides. Lightly spray the foil with cooking spray.

# Pulse 1 cup of pretzel pieces in a food processor until finely ground (yields about 1/2 cup crumbs). Transfer to a bowl and whisk in flour, baking powder and salt.

# Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat and stir in brown sugar. Let cool slightly, then stir in eggs and vanilla.
# Stir in the pretzel crumb mixture to the butter mixture in two additions.

# Spread the batter in the prepared pan. Scatter the remaining pretzel pieces evenly on top.
# Bake until golden and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool completely in the pan on a rack.

# Turn the oven on to broil.

# Lift the bars in the foil out of the pan and transfer to a baking sheet.

# Press the marshmallow halves, cut side down, in even rows on top of the bars.

# Broil, rotating the sheet to ensure even browning of the marshmallow pieces, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove and let cool.

# Place peanut butter chips and 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil in a microwave safe bowl and microwave on high for 30 second intervals, stirring, until chips are fully melted.

# Repeat with chocolate chips in a separate bowl.

# Drizzle melted peanut butter and chocolate mixtures over the bars.

# Let harden at room temperature or chilled before cutting bars.
