!! Argentine Hot Dogs (with Chimichurri, Pickled Red Onions, Marinated Queso Fresco &amp;&nbsp;Chorizo)

(Slightly adapted from the [[http://www.mercurynews.com/recipes/ci_18685935 | San Jose Mercury News]], original recipe by Carole Wendling; Serves 2)

'''For the Chimichurri:'''

1/2 a bunch of parsley, chopped \\
1/4 cup olive oil \\
Juice of 1 small lemon \\
1 TBS. red wine vinegar \\
1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes \\
1/4 tsp. crushed garlic \\
1/4 cup finely diced red and yellow peppers \\
2 tablespoons grated carrot

'''For the Pickled Red Onions:'''

1/2 red onion, sliced \\
2 TBS. white wine vinegar (or champagne vinegar) \\
agave nectar to taste \\
Kosher salt to taste

'''For the Marinated Queso Fresco:'''

4 ounces queso fresco, crumbled \\
2 tablespoons olive oil \\
1/4 teaspoon crushed garlic \\
Zest from 1/2 lemon \\
Salt, pepper to taste

'''To Assemble:'''

2 grilled beef hot dogs \\
1 sweet or sour steak roll &ndash; cut in half lengthwise, with a slit cut into each half to form 2 hot dog &ldquo;buns&rdquo; \\
4 ounces ground chorizo, cooked


* To make the pickled onions, place the sliced onions in a bowl and add the vinegar. Add a good drizzle of agave nectar (or you can use honey or sugar) and season with a little salt. Stir to combine. Taste and add more sweetener if needed. Cover and refrigerate overnight.

* Combine the marinated queso fresco ingredients. Cover and refrigerate overnight.

* Make the chimichurri. Combine the first six ingredients in a food processor; pulse to pesto-like consistency. Season to taste with salt. Fold in peppers and carrot. Set aside. Can be made several hours ahead. Cover and chill. Take out of refrigerator 1 hour before serving.

* Lightly toast the buns on the grill, grill the hot dogs, and top with cooked, crumbled chorizo, chimichurri, pickled red onions, and marinated queso fresco.
