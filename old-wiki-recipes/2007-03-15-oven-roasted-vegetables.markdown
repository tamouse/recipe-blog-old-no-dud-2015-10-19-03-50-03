I love oven-roasted vegetables. They bring a distinctive flavour to salads and other dishes, as well as being great as an accompaniment to a main dish. 

This recipe came from somewhere, and as I read it over, it seems pretty rigid. Feel free to let loose with pretty much anything.

!!Ingredients

* 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar [^There is something about balsamic vinegar that seems essential for roasted veggies.^]
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 1/2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning [^One of the key herbs to use here is Rosemary. It is usually included in Italian Seasoning, but if you don't have that, a good mixture of Rosemary, Marjoram, Parsley, Sage, Thyme, Basil and/or Oregano is good.^]
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon pepper
* 3 garlic cloves crushed
* 1 1/2 cups asparagus 1 1/2 inch pieces
* 2 medium zucchini 12 ounces  cut crosswise into 1 inch slices
* 2 medium yellow squash 12 ounces cut crosswise into 1 inch slices
* 1 large red onions 12 ounces cut into 8 wedges
* 1 large red bell pepper 6 ounces cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces
* olive oil in a spray bottle

!!Directions
#Heat oven to 425{$DegF}
#Combine first 6 ingredients in a large bowl; stir with a whisk. 
#Add vegetables; toss well to coat. [^This gets easier if you just put the oil, vinegar, spices and veggies in a big ziplock bag and shake it well before putting on the baking pan.^]
#Arrange vegetables in a single layer on a baking pan; spray with olive oil. 
#Bake at 425{$DegF} for 40 minutes or until tender and lightly browned, stirring occasionally.
