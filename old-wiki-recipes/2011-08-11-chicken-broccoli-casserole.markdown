* 1/4 parmesan cheese
* salt and pepper
* thyme
* sage
* dry mustard
* monterey chicken spice blend

!!Variations

Some possible variations:
* use cheddar cheese instead or in addition to parmesan
* use cheddar cheese soup instead of cream of mushroom
* use bread crumbs or cracker crumbs instead of onion rings (if i did this, i'd also sauté onions while cooking the chicken)
* use a seasoned bread stuffing, maybe 2 cups
* possibly make a cornbread stuffing and mix it in with the casserole(?)
* can vary the spices tremendously with this dish, I think. Basil/Oregano, or Rosemary, or even go for Cardamom, Cumin, or Curry. Could also go hot with Cayenne, Chili, Pepper Sauce, etc.

Okay, this didn't turn out quite as well as I'd hoped. Everyone agreed it tasted good, but it wasn't very spectacular. It may have cooked too long as the broccoli was rather overdone. Next time I think I'll try green beans instead of broccoli. Also, the spicing wasn't quite right. Given the salt content of the canned soup and the onion rings, no additional salt needed to be added. The Thyme and Sage didn't really work too well either, perhaps they needed more time to bloom effectively.

I think the wine is what made this recipe '''not''' work. Suggestion to omit from recipe and provide a wine sauce to add upon serving by Inoru @ #dw-b

Here are the alterations I'd make:
* 1/2 can of the mushroom soup for these amounts instead of a whole can.
* Use only 1/2 the can of onion rings instead of the whole can (or use the smaller can instead of the larger can).
* omit salting the chicken while it's cooking.
* Omit the Thyme and Sage. Try it with Rosemary (not very much!)
* Add a little garlic powder.
* Cook it for less time (30 minutes first part, 10 minutes second part).
* Try fresh green beans instead of broccoli.
* Used grated cheddar instead of grated parmesan.
