!! Quinoa Pilaf Recipe

[[#ingredients]]
!! Ingredients

* Olive oil
* 1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped
* 1/2 bell pepper, finely chopped
* 1 garlic clove, minced
* 1/4 cup pine nuts
* 2 cups [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinoa | quinoa]]
* 4 cups water
* 1/8 teaspoon pepper
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh mint
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil or Thai basil*
* 2 Tbsp chopped fresh chives (or green onions including the greens)
* 1 cucumber, peeled, seeds removed, chopped
* Salt and pepper

[[#directions]]
!! Directions

# Place quinoa in a large sieve and rinse it until the water runs clear. Heat 2 Tbsp of olive oil on medium high heat in a 3-4 quart pot. Add the onion, bell pepper, garlic and pine nuts and cook, stirring occasionally until the onions are translucent, but not browned. Add the drained quinoa and cook, stirring occasionally for a couple more minutes. You can let some of the quinoa get a little toasted.

# Add 4 cups of water and one teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil and reduce the heat to low so that the quinoa and water are simmering while the pot is partially covered (enough to let out some steam). Simmer for 20 minutes, or until the quinoa is tender and the water has been absorbed. Remove from heat and put into a large serving bowl. Fluff up with a fork.

# Let cool until just slightly warm, add 2-3 more tablespoons of olive oil. Stir in chopped mint, basil, chives, and cucumber. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Serve chilled or at room temperature.
