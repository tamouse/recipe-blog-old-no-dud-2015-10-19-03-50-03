!!Ingredients
* 1 lb elbow macaroni (or any other type of pasta you prefer), cooked and drained. Make this when you start the cheese sauce
* 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1/3 cup flour
* 3 cups milk (use what you&rsquo;d like. I used 2%)
* 1 lb medium sharp cheddar cheese
* 8 ounces monterey jack cheese (if not jack, make sure it is a nice sharp cheese)
* 1 teaspoon kosher or sea salt
* 1/2 teaspoon chipotle powder (don&rsquo;t worry; doesn&rsquo;t make this spicy. Just adds a little something. If you are totally against chipotle, try smoked paprika)
* 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
* 4 medium to large onions
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 lb good quality bacon, chopped and cooked

!!Directions
# Slice your onions in thin rings, Add the olive oil to a large wide bottomed pan and let heat for about 30 seconds.
# Add in the onions and cover the pan. Cook the onions over medium low heat, stirring frequently, until they are soft and golden brown. Do NOT rush this process. It will take about 30 to 40 minutes to get nicely caramelized onions. If you turn the heat up, yep, they will brown, but that is fried onions and there is a definite taste difference. Fried onions can get a bitter edge to them. When done, set them aside and preheat your oven to 350 degrees.
# Melt the butter in a large sauce pan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and continue to cook, whisking for about 3 minutes or so.
# Slowly add the milk, whisking as you do. Cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce comes to a gentle boil and thickens. This will take about 8 to 10 minutes.
# Add in the cheeses, salt, chipotle and garlic powder. Stir until the cheese melts. Add in the caramelized onions and the bacon pieces
# Pour the sauce over the cooked pasta. Pour everything into a buttered 13&times;9 glass dish or individual ramekins. Top with more shredded cheese and if you&rsquo;re hating your arteries, more bacon.
# Cook in a 350 degree oven for just about 10 minutes; just long enough to melt the cheese on top and firm up the mac and cheese.
# Serve this oooey gooey goodness to your favorite people. Including two year olds who will eat cardboard.
