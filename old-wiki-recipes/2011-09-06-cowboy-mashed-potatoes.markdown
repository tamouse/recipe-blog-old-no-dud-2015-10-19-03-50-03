Serve this with the ParmesanSagePorkChops.

!!Ingredients

* 2 red potatoes, diced
* 2 Yukon Gold (yellow) potatoes, diced
* 1/2 fresh jalape&ntilde;o pepper, sliced '''(Follow normal precautions for dealing with peppers)'''
* 1 large carrot, peeled and diced
* 1 clove garlic, peeled and minced
* 1/2 cup frozen white corn, thawed
* 2 tablespoon butter
* 2 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese
* salt and pepper to taste

!!Directions

# Place red potatoes, yellow potatoes, jalape&ntilde;o pepper, carrots and garlic cloves in a large pot. 

# Cover with water, and bring to a boil over high heat, turn down to medium high. Cook 15  minutes.

# Add corn to pot. Cook 5 minutes more or until potatoes are tender.

# Drain water from pot.

# Add butter.

# Mash the mixture with a potato masher until butter is melted and potatoes have reached desired consistency. 

# Mix in cheese, salt, and pepper. 

# Serve hot.

!!Variations

Since some members of my family cannot deal with peppers, I have to omit the jalape&ntilde;o. If I were making it with peppers, I'd probably use haba&ntilde;ero instead of jalape&ntilde;o since I'm none too keen on the flavour. Alternatively, this would probably taste completely awesome with chipotl&eacute; instead of jalape&ntilde;os.
