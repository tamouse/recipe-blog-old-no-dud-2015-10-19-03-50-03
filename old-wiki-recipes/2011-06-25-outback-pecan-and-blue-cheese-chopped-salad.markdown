!!!Candied cinnamon pecans

*    1/3 cup pecans sliced-lengthwise
*    1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
*    1 Tablespoon dark brown sugar
*    1 1/2 teaspoons butter, melted

!!!Salad

*    3 cups chopped butter or bibb lettuce
*    3 cups chopped red leaf lettuce
*    3 cups chopped iceberg lettuce
*    1 green onion, chopped

!!!Blue cheese vinaigrette dressing

*    1/4 cup olive oil
*    1/4 cup white wine vinegar
*    1/4 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
*    2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
*    2 tablespoons sour cream
*    2 tablespoons honey
*    1 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
*    salt & freshly ground black pepper, to taste
*    1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese ''(as i recall, Outback doesn't put the blue cheese in the dressing, but assembles it with the salad ingredients separately)''

!!Directions

#    Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
#    Slice each pecan half into at least three lengthwise pieces.
#    Combine the cinnamon and brown sugar.
#    Toss the pecans with the melted butter, then with the cinnamon/sugar mixture, making sure to coat them all evenly.
#    Put the nuts on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for 5 to 8 minutes, until sugar is caramelized.
#    Remove the baking sheet from the oven and slide the pecans off of the parchment to cool.
#    Chop all of the lettuce into small bite-sized pieces; and rinse them with cool water.
#    Slice the green onion.
#    Whisk together the vinaigrette ingredients.
#    Place the chopped lettuce into a serving bowl large enough to allow you to toss the salad.
#    Add the vinaigrette and toss thoroughly.
#    Sprinkle with the chopped onion.
#    Break the cooled pecan slices apart and sprinkle them over the salad.
#    Enjoy!
