[[#directions]]
!!Directions
!!!Cake
# Heat oven to 375{$DegF}.
# Grease and flour an 8x12 inch rectangular pan.

# Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

# In a large bowl, cream together the 1/2 cup butter, 3/4 cup sugar and the vanilla until light and fluffy.
# Add the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition.
# Add the flour mixture alternately with the milk; beat well.

# Pour the batter into the 8x12 inch pan.
# Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean.
# Let stand 5 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
# Store overnight to give the cake a chance to firm up before Icing.

!!!Icing
# In a large bowl, combine confectioners' sugar and cocoa.
# In a saucepan, heat milk and 2 teaspoons butter until the butter is melted.
# Add the milk to the sugar mixture and mix well to create a fluid, but not too runny, Icing.

!!!Procedure
''The Icing will drip, so place a sheet of parchment paper under the rack to catch the drips.''

# Cut the cake into 24 squares.
# Place coconut in a shallow container.
# Using a fork, dip each square into the icing, then roll it in the coconut.
# Place onto rack to dry.
# Continue for each piece.

Summary:"Lamingtons are little sponge cakes coated in chocolate and grated coconut. A traditional Australian treat that appeals to most. Any firm type of plain cake can be used: butter-cake, pound-cake, Madeira cake or genoise sponge."
