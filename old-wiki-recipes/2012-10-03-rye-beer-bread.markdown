[[#ingredients]]
!!Ingredients:
* 2 cups rye flour
* 1 1/2 cups room temperature beer
* 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
* 2 tablespoons white sugar
* 1 tablespoon salt
* 2 tablespoons shortening
* 1 egg
* 3 cups bread flour
* 1 tablespoon caraway seed (optional)
* 1 tablespoon cornmeal

[[#directions]]
!!Directions:
# Combine rye flour, beer, and yeast in a large bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Set out overnight. Do not refrigerate.
# The next day, add sugar, salt, shortening, and egg; beat with mixer until smooth. Stir in caraway seeds, if wanted. Add enough white bread flour to make a soft dough.
# Knead on a lightly floured surface until smooth, approximately 10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, and turn to oil the surface of the dough. Let rise in warm place about 1 hour, or until doubled.
# Punch down dough, and divide in half. Shape into round or oblong loaves, and place on greased baking sheets sprinkled with corn meal. Let rise for 30 minutes.
# Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Cool on racks.
