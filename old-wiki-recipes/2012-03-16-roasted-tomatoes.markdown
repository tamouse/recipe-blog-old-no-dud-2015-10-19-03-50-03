Tomatoes from the grocery and out of season are generally not very interesting. Roasting them gives them a great kick and brings out some lucious flavours that just using them fresh or stewed won't provide. Roasted tomatoes are a great addition to soups and stews, and marinara or bolognese sauces.

[[#ingredients]]

* 2 pounds raw roma tomatoes, washed
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
