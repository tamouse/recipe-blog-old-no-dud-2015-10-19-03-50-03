This recipe is pretty similar to CauliflowerSalad, but has a flair all it's own as well. This has always been a big hit at potlucks and barbeques, often being specially requested.

!!Ingredients
* 1 large bunch of broccoli
* 12 strips of bacon
* 1/2 cup raisins
* 1 cup sunflower seeds
* 1 small red onion
* 1 cup miracle whip
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1/3 cup parmesan cheese
* 2 tablespoons white vinegar
* seasoned croutons

!!Directions
This is best made in two parts, one part to let the salad get nice and flavourful is made at least 4 hours ahead. The second part is all the ingredients that might get mushy if set in the dressing, is made just before serving.

!!!Part 1 - made ahead of time
# set a huge kettle full of water on the stove to boil
# chop up broccoli into small, bite-sized bits ''(I tend to use just the flowerettes. I dislike stems)''
# when the water is at full boil, blanch the broccoli pieces for 1 minute. drain and plunge into cold water immediately.
# peel and thinly slice a red onion, separating all the layers
# in a bowl, mix together the dressing ingredients: miracle whip, sugar, parmesan cheese, white vinegar
# drain the broccoli and put into a large mixing bowl
# add the raisins and sliced red onion
# add in the dressing, mixing everything thoroughly together
# put salad in the refrigerator for a minimum of 4 hours

!!!Part 2 - made just before serving
# slice up the bacon strips into bits and fry in a medium heat
# when the bacon is fully cooked, remove from pan with slotted spoon and set on paper towels to drain and dry
# add bacon bits, sunflower seeds, and croutons to salad, mix thoroughly
# serve immediately
