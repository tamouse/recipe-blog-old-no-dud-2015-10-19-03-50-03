[[#excerpt]]
Making your own stock is a great way to use leftover things like poultry carcases, meat bones, etc.
[[#excerptend]]

This is for a meat-based stock. For vegetarian stock, see MakingVegetableStock.

[[#ingredients]]
!!Ingredients
* 8 to 12 cups water
* 3 to 4 peeled and diced carrots
* 2 to 3 cleaned and diced celery stalks -- you can include the tops here as well
* 2 medium onions, peeled and diced
* whatever herbs you might like to add -- marjoram, thyme, rosemary, sage, etc
* salt and pepper to taste -- I tend to go very light on the salt, or omit it entirely, depending on the meat being used
* some leftover meat products. Examples include:
** Turkey carcass leftover from roasting a bird (we typically have this at Thanksgiving and/or Christmas)
** Carcass from a store-bought rotissery chicken
** Smoked Ham hocks (not recommending you use these for ingredients in other dishes, necessarily. They have a lot of fat and grisle, and not that much actual meat)
** Smoked turkey legs (these come two to a package in our local grocery store)



[[#directions]]
!!Directions
# %item value=1%Put the carrots, celery, onions and left over meat in a large stock pot.

# %item value=2%Add enough water to cover, 8 to 12 cups of cold water.

# %item value=3%Add in whatever seasonings you'd like.

%rframe%[[{$Name}-Attach01|Attach:simmering-stock-120.jpg]]
# %item value=4%Bring to a boil on the stove top. Cover and turn down to a simmer, for 2 hours or so.

[[<<]]

# %item value=5%Let the stock cool, placing into a fairly cold area (the refrigerator works great, but I use our porch during the winter as it gets equally cold!).

[[<<]]

%rframe%[[{$Name}-Attach02|Attach:cooked-and-cooled-stock-120.jpg]]
# %item value=6% Skim the congealed fat off after the stock has cooled, also removing whatever bones, grisle, fat and things you don't want.

[[<<]]

%rframe%[[{$Name}-Attach03|Attach:strained-stock-120.jpg]] 
# %item value=7%Strain the stock into a large bowl.

[[<<]]

# %item value=8%Use the stock straight away, or freeze it for future use.

# %item value=9%You can reserve the strained contents for other uses, such as in [[SplitPeaSoupWithHam|soup]].

Stock freezes really well. Some great suggestions are to freeze it in ice cube trays so you have small amounts needed for some recipes, or to freeze it in single recipe units for larger uses.

The last time I made stock, I used smoked ham hocks. This made some great stock, but then I tried to use the hocks in [[SplitPeaSoupWithHam|split pea soup]] and it didn't turn out so well.
