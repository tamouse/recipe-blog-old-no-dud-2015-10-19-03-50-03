This is a quick and easy main dish, something I sort of whipped up on
the spur of the moment.

[[#ingredients]]
!!Ingredients
* 3 small or 2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cubed
* salt and pepper
* other seasoning as desired (I used Monterey Chicken Spice Blend)
* 1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms, or 1 small can sliced mushroom pieces, drained
* 1/4 cup apricot preserves
* 1/4 cup Gewürtztraminer
* 2 tablespoons tamari sauce
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil

[[#directions]]
!!Directions

# Spray a skillet with vegetable oil coating (or use 1 tablespoon
  olive oil or the like).

# If using fresh mushrooms, saut&eacute; them in butter or olive oil until they release their liquid, about 3 minutes. Set aside.

# Over medium heat, sauté the chicken, adding the salt, pepper and spices.

# As the chicken nears done, add in the mushrooms, apricot preserves, tamari sauce and sesame oil.

# If the sauce is too thin, sprinkle in a '''little''' flour to thicken it.

Serve over fresh greens or with rice or other grain accompaniment.

Everyone who reads this (and other recipes I use canned mushrooms in) says "I'd use real mushrooms." Well, yes, you certainly can. I might too if I remember to buy them and use them. Canned ones mean I don't have to worry about fresh ones going bad, or going to the store when I want to make this.
