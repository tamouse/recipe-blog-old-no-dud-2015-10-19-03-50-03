(:comment a few notes about the recipe are sometimes nice:)
While popping open a can of Hormel is pretty dang easy, it's also not quite so satisfying sometimes. Here's a quick stove-top chili recipe that comes out pretty nice and is a great basis for further experimentation.

[[#ingredients]]
!!Ingredients

* 2 pounds ground beef
* 1 onion, chopped
* 2-3 cloves minced garlic
* 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)
* 2 1/2 cups tomato sauce
* 1 (8 ounce) jar salsa [[#salsanote|*]]
* 4 tablespoons chili seasoning mix, or
** 1 tablespoon ground cumin
** 1 tablespoon chili powder
** 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1 (15 ounce) can light red kidney beans [[#beans|**]]
* 1 (15 ounce) can dark red kidney beans

[[#directions]]
!!Directions

# In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the ground beef, onion, garlic, salt and pepper, and sauté  until meat is browned and onion is tender. Drain grease.

# Add the ground black pepper, salt, tomato sauce, salsa, chili seasoning mix and both cans of kidney beans. Mix well, reduce heat to low and simmer for at least an hour.

!!Variations

* chopped, roasted jalapeños (chipotles)
* mild, green roasted chili peppers
* fresh, chopped habañeros
* other veggies go in well, too:
** grated carrots
** grated zucchini
** chopped bell peppers
** stewed tomatoes
* black beans instead of kidney beans
* white navy beans
* lima beans

[[#salsanote]]
[=*=] There are many varieties of salsa to choose from in most supermarkets. Different heat indexes, different consistencies, different ingredients. Use whatever floats your boat. I'm partial to Pace Medium Chunky Salsa.

[[#beans]]
[=**=] If you don't want to use canned beans, you can use dried beans instead, provided you prepare them well by boiling, soaking, draining, etc.
