(:title Tamara's Quick Bolognese Sauce:)

This is the quick and easy method for throwing together a typical bolognese sauce for spaghetti or vermicelli. Ingredients are easy to come by, and this requires no particular skill

!!Ingredients
* 1 medium onion, peeled and chopped
* 1 tablespoon bottled crushed garlic
* 1 pound or so of ground beef (lean as possible)
* Basil
* Oregano
* Chili Powder
* Salt
* Pepper
* 1 can sliced mushrooms
* Bottle of Ragu -- choose your favourite, I use Chunky Mushroom
* 1 can diced tomatoes (I prefer the basil and garlic ones)
* 1/2 cup red wine

!!Directions
# Put the onion, garlic and ground beef together in a large frying pan and brown the beef and all that.
# Sprinkle on liberal amounts of spices while the beef, onion and garlic is cooking. mix it in well.
# Drain any fat once the beef is cooked.
# Pour in the wine and add the mushrooms, let simmer for a few minutes.
# Pour in the bottled spaghetti sauce and diced tomatoes, let simmer until it reduces to the consistency you like it.
# Serve over al dente spaghetti or vermicelli.
