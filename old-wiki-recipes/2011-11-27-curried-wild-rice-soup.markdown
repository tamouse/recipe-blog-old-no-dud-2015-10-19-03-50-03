This is a classic from my mom's collection of recipes. I'm not sure where it came from originally, but it sure is a winner!


[[#ingredients]]
!!Ingredients
* 2/3 cup uncooked, or 2 cups cooked, wild rice
* 1/4 cup butter
* 1 onion
* 2 stalks celery
* 1/2 pound fresh, or 1 large can of mushrooms
* 1/2 cup flour
* 6 cups chicken or turkey stock[^I make the turkey stock from the carcass of the Thanksgiving turkey beforehand^]
* 2 cups heavy cream or half-and-half
* 1/2 teaspoon curry powder
* 1/2 teaspoon ground sage
* 1/2 teaspoon salt (to taste)
* fresh ground pepper
* 8 ounces cooked turkey meat[^usually there is enough from picking the meat form the carcass used for making stock. Beware of bones!^]
* 1/2 cup white wine

[[#directions]]
!!Directions
# Cook the [[WildRice|wild rice]].

# Dice an onion, fine.

# Dice the celery, fine.

# Chop up mushrooms, not too fine.


# In a large pot (I use our large Revereware dutch oven), melt butter. Add chopped onion, chopped celery, and chopped mushrooms. Sauté the mixture until onions become transparent, about 2 minutes.

# Add half cup of flour and cook for a minute, while mixture bubbles.

# Slowly add the stock, stirring to let it start to boil and thicken. Let boil for a couple minutes.

# Add the cream or half-and-half, again slowly, stirring while adding. Let simmer (not boil) for a few minutes.

# Add the remaining ingredients and let simmer for 10 minutes.

# Ladle into bowls and serve immediately.
