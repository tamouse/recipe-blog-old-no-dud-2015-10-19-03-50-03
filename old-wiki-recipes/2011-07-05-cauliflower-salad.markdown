This has been a favourite in my family since I was kid. It's quite similar to BroccoliSalad -- I think one came from the other, but I'm not sure which order that happened in.

[[#ingredients]]
!!Ingredients
* 1 large head cauliflower
* 1 spanish (sweet) onion (or a red onion)
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1/3 cup parmesan cheese
* 2 cups miracle whip
* 1 large head of lettuce
* 1 pound of bacon
* 1/2 box good seasoned croutons

[[#directions]]
!!Directions

This salad is made in two parts. The first part is made ahead of time, and the second part is made and put together just before serving.

!!!Part 1 - do ahead
# break up cauliflower into small bite-sized chunks
# slice onion very thinly and separate layers
# in a bowl, mix sugar, parmesan cheese and miracle whip together
# combine cauliflower, onion and dressing and stir to coat completely
# refrigerate for at least 4 hours, overnight is better

!!!Part 2 - do while part 1 is chilling
# slice up bacon and fry in a pan
# remove bacon pieces with a slotted spoon and set on paper towels to drain and dry
# break up head of lettuce into small, bite-sized pieces

!!!Part 3 - just before serving
# combine salad from Part 1 with Part 2
# serve
