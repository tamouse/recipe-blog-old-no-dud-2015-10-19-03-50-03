I was right on all three counts.%0a%0aI posted this recipe [[http://www.flouronmyface.com/2011/12/garlic-and-rosemary-bread.html | here ]] the first time I made it. A few weeks ago I decided to make it again but this time replace some of the all purpose flour with bread flour. I wanted to see if the bread flour could make this loaf even better then it already was.%0a%0aOh '''Yes''' it did!%0a%0aThe bread flour made the loaf denser.%0a%0aWith the addition of bread flour it turned out even more like that expensive loaf of artisan bread.%0a%0aTry both recipes or just try this one. I promise you won't be sorry.%0a%0aI make this loaf of bread to eat with a baked ham and heirloom tomato sandwich and I love it.%0a%0aIt is one of the best sandwiches I make. I'm drooling just thinking about it.%0a%0aI may have to make it this week since I have an heirloom tomato sitting on my counter! A quick trip to the grocery store and the ham will be here also.%0a%0aYou may use fresh rosemary or dried rosemary in this recipe. I have done both. Nothing beat fresh rosemary but not everyone has a rosemary plant in their yard. The first time I made this recipe I didn’t either but have since planted one.%0a%0aSoaking the dried rosemary in the olive oil before adding it to the dough helps keep the rosemary from getting too dry during the baking process.%0a%0aYou can shape this loaf into two rounds or bake it in a loaf pan if you want.%0a%0aI like the rustic look of a hand formed loaf myself so that is how I make it.%0a%0aBe sure to brush the loaves with plenty of olive oil before baking. The olive oil does something wonderful to the crust as it bakes. The crust will be flaky and so much more buttery then if you actually used butter.%0a%0aYou can of course make this recipe without a stand mixer. Simply mix and knead by hand. Be sure to knead by hand the proper amount of time to make sure the gluten has a chance to form.%0a%0aOne of the biggest mistakes you can make when making homemade bread is to not knead the dough properly. This is the most important step in the bread making process.%0a%0aHappy baking!%0a%0aIngredients%0a%0a* 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour%0a* 2 cups bread flour%0a* 1 &frac14; cup warm water, divided%0a* 3 to 5 tbs olive oil%0a* 2 &frac12; tbs dry or fresh rosemary, crushed%0a* 5 cloves garlic, minced%0a* 1 tbs active dry yeast%0a* 2 &frac12; tsp salt%0a* 2 &frac12; tsp sugar%0a%0a%0aInstructions%0a%0a# Mince the garlic and crush the dry rosemary or mince the fresh and place into a small bowl.%0a# Pour about a teaspoon of olive oil over the garlic and rosemary. Stir to moisten the dry rosemary (if using dry) or to coat the fresh rosemary and garlic. Set aside.%0a# Put &frac12; cup of water into a small bowl and warm to body temperature in the microwave.%0a# Sprinkle the yeast over the water and stir. Set aside.%0a# In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook put the flour, salt and sugar.%0a# Turn the mixer on low and mix for about 1 minute.%0a# Measure &frac34; cup of water into another bowl and add 3 tablespoons of olive oil.%0a# Warm in the microwave to body temperature.%0a# Turn the mixer on low and add yeast and water. Mix for one minute.%0a# Pour the warm water and olive oil into the mixer and mix for about 2 minutes on low.%0a# Pour in the olive oil and herbs.%0a# Turn the mixer on medium low and knead with the dough hook for about 5 minutes.%0a# If the dough seems too wet add about a tablespoon of flour at a time to the bowl and continue to knead. If the dough seems too dry dribble about a teaspoon of olive oil into the bowl.%0a# Knead until smooth or about 8 to 10 minutes in total.%0a# Place the ball of dough into a greased bowl and set in a warm spot till it doubles in size, about 1 hour. I put the bowl in my oven with the light turned on.%0a# After the dough has risen punch down and divide in half.%0a# You can form the dough into two rounds or two small French bread loaves on a greased cookie sheet or a pizza stone sprinkled with cornmeal.%0a# Let loaves rise until doubled. About an hour.%0a# After the loaves have risen if you have been using your oven to keep them warm remove them from the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.%0a# Carefully brush some olive oil over the tops.%0a# Bake the loaves for 30 to 40 minutes or until the loaves sound hollow when you knock on the bottom.%0a# Cool on cooling racks.%0a# Cool completely before cutting.%0a%0aNotes%0a%0aEnjoy!%0a(:linkwikiwords:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0aPosted: 2012-06-13T09:50:23-0500%0a%0a>>comment%3c%3c%0aSummary:a great recipe for an artisan style bread with rosemary%0aParent:(Recipes.)BakedGoods%0aIncludeMe:[[Recipes.BakedGoods]]%0aSource:[[Flour On My Face Blog: Garlic Rosemary Bread II  -> http://www.flouronmyface.com/2012/06/garlic-rosemary-bread-ii.html]]%0aCategories:[[!BakedGoods]],[[!Links]]%0aTags: bread, rosemary, baking%0a(:tags-hide bread, rosemary, baking:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a
