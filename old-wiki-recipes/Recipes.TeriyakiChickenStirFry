While this may be convenient so you don't have to remember to thaw out the chicken pieces, it really works better if you can cube the chicken at the start of the dish rather than having to cook it thawed to the point you can cut it up. Thawed, cubed chicken cooks much more uniformly and takes on the flavourings of the teriyaki sauce better, I've found, and it cooks a lot faster as well.%0a%0a(:ifend:)%0a%0a
