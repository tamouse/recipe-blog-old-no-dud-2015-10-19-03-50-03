[[#ingredients]]
!!Ingredients
* 3/4 cup flour

  drizzles from whisk in a thin stream, about 1 minute

# In a 12-inch cast iron or other heavy bottomed skillet over medium
  heat, melt butter. Lay apple slices in butter in a single layer and
  cook, without stirring, for 2 minutes. Gently flip slices and cook
  for another 2 minutes until tender.

My friend, Marina, makes a version of this without apples, and tops
with powdered sugar and lemon juice as well. This is their traditional
holiday breakfast dish.
