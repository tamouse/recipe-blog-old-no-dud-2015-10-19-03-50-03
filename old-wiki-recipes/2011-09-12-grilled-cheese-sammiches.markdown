[[#excerpt]]
Grilled cheese sammiches are the traditional midwestern comfort food. Paired with tomato soup, they are wonderful for when things are cold and blowy, or when you don't want to think about what to make.

!!Directions
(:comment ordered list of steps to follow:)

# warm up a pan or griddle. [^The heat of the griddle/pan will depend on how long you grill for -- don't set the heat too high as it is much more likely to end up with charred bread and solid insides. Lower heat is more easily managed.^]'^,^' [^If you have a sandwich/panini grill, or one of those George Foreman Grills, they can make doing grilled cheese really easy, grilling both sided of the sandwich at the same time, and smooshing it a bit to give some extra tooth.^]

# butter the outsides of both slices of bread.

# when the griddle/pan is hot, lay one slice of bread, butter-side down, on the griddle.

# layer on the slices of cheese you want. Use a fairly good amount. Mixing varieties of cheese is also pretty wonderful.

# layer on whatever [[#additions|additions]] you want.

# place the top slice of bread, butter-side up, on top.

# let grill for about 5 minutes on the side. Flip entire sandwich over and grill other side for about 5 minutes.
