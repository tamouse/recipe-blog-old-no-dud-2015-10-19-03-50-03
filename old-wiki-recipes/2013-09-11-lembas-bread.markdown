[[#ingredients]]
!!Ingredients
*2 1/2 cups of flour
*1 tablespoon of baking powder
*1/4 teaspoon of salt
*8 tablespoons of cold butter (1 stick)
*1/3 cup of brown sugar
*1 teaspoon of cinnamon
*1/2 teaspoon maple syrup/honey
*2/3 cup of milk/heavy cream (or more, if necessary)
*1/2 teaspoon of vanilla

[[#directions]]
!!Directions

#Preheat oven to 220 degrees Celcius (425 degrees Fahrenheit).
# Mix the flour, baking powder and salt into a large bowl.
# Add the butter and mix with a fork or a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles fine granules.
# Add the sugar and cinnamon, and mix them thoroughly into the mixture.
# Add the milk/cream and vanilla and stir them in with a fork until a nice, thick dough forms.
# Roll the dough out about 1/2 in thickness.
# Cut out 3-inch squares and transfer the dough to a cookie sheet.
# Criss-cross (DO NOT cut all the way) each square from corner-to-corner with a knife.
# Bake for about 12 minutes or more (depending on the thickness of the bread) until it is set and lightly golden.

(the recipe makes about 10-12 pieces of lembas)
