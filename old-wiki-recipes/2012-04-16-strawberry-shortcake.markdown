! Shortcakes
These are really just slightly modified drop biscuits. Nothing special here, really.
[[#ingredients]]
!!Ingredients
* 1.25 cups bisquick, or other biscuit mix
* 1/3 cup milk, more or less
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

[[#directions]]
!!Directions
# Heat oven to 450{$DegF}.

# Combine bisquick, milk, vanilla, and cinnamon, stir until just mixed, don't over beat. Dough will be rather sticky.

# Drop dough onto baking sheet, the amounts given should make 3 good sized biscuits. Flatten a little bit.

# Bake for 10-12 minutes until biscuits are light brown.

!Strawberries
Fresh strawberries in season cannot be beat. I like a lot of strawberries, usually using one of the 2-pint containers for this.
!!Ingredients
* Fresh strawberries
* Sweetener (plain sugar works great, but other sweeteners can work as well)
!!Directions
# Wash strawberries thoroughly

# Remove stems and chop into 1/4" dice

# Mix sweetener of choice over cut up strawberries

# Let chill for an hour or so

!Assembly
