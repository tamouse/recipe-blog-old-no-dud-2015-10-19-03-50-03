This recipe came out of a Williams-Sonoma catalog, which coincidently is where we purchased the frittata pan...

!!Ingredients
* 2 large or 3 smaller russet potatoes, 1.25 pound total, scrubbed, cut into 1" dice.
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
* 4 thick bacon slices, cut into 3/4" dice
* 4 eggs
* 3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese
* 2 teaspoon fresh chives, minced
* 1/4 cup sour cream

!!Directions
# Heat oven to {-500-} 400{$DegF} [^500{$DegF} was ''way'' to hot for our oven; I reduced the temp to 400{$DegF} which was much better.^]

# In a bowl, combine potatoes, oil, salt and pepper. Transfer to baking sheet; bake, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 30 minutes. Let cool 30  minutes. [^I don't bother letting the potatoes cool. I prepare everything else while the pototoes are baking.^]

# In deep half of frittata pan over medium-high heat, cook bacon until crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Discard fat. 

# Finely chop 2 tablespoons of bacon, reserve for garnish.

# In large bowl, whisk eggs, salt, pepper, 1/2 cup cheese and 1 teaspoon of the chives.

# In deep half of frittata pan over medium heat, add potatoes and diced bacon to pan. Pour in the egg mixture.

# Cook, using spatula to lift the edges and allow uncooked egg to flow under, about 2 minutes, then cook 4-5 minutes more.

# Lightly brush the shallow half of frittata pan with remaining oil, heat over medium heat. Place shallow pan over deep pan and flip contents into shallow pan.

# Cook, shallow side down, covered, until eggs are set, about 3 minutes.

# Uncover pan, sprinkle frittata with cheese.

# Bake frittata for 4 minutes

# Slide onto serving plate, garnish with extra bacon and chives, serve with sour cream.

!!Variations

I added saut&eacute;ed fresh mushrooms, cooked in a little bit of the bacon drippings.

It's perfectly okay to use a couple of green onions instead of the chives.

For extra zest, you can add italian herbs, paprika or what-have-you to both the potatoes and the egg mixture (just don't overdo it!).

Summary:Frittatas are like fancy omelettes with potatoes. This one is very tasty
