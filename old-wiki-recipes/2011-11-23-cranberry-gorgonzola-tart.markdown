Serve as an appetizer, side dish, or dessert.

I'm quite unsure what they mean by "thin layer of cranberry mixture" -- a 12 ounce bag is going to make a fair bit of sauce, I'm assuming a thin layer is like enough to get a whole set of berries on top in a single layer. I guess you just serve up the rest of the cranberries alone.

The recipe also does not say how long to let the final tart sit to set. I'd guess at least an hour or two.
