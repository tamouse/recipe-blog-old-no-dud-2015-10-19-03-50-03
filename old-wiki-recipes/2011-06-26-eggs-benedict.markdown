Eggs Benedict is one of the fancy looking and sounding dishes that turn out to be a breeze to make. If you're not up for making the hollandaise yourself, you can get it in dry packets and make it up.

!!Ingredients
* 2 eggs
* 2 slices Canadian bacon or ham
* 1 English muffin, split
* HollandaiseSauce

!!Directions
# Poach eggs for 10 minutes or so, less if you like it more runny, more if you like it more dry

# Fry the Canadian bacon or ham in a skillet for a few minutes

# Toast the English muffin halves

# Warm up the sauce

# Arrange the English muffins on a plate, top each half with a slice of the Canadian bacon, a put the poached eggs on each.

# Cover with hollandaise sauce.

# NOM!


!!Variations
There are tons of variations possible here:
* Bacon or sausage patties instead of the Canadian bacon or ham
* Sliced grilled tomatoes instead of the meat (or in addition if you want!)
* Cheddar cheese sauce instead of hollandaise
* Country gravy instead of hollandaise
* Chipotle cheese sauce instead of hollandaise
