[[#ingredients]]
!!Ingredients
* 2 acorn squash
* 1/2 cup chopped onion
* 1 cup diced celery
* 1/2 cup grated carrots
* 1/2 cup chopped walnuts
* 1 tablespoon dried parsley, or 1/4 cup fresh chopped parsley
* 1 teaspoon dry rubbed sage
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed rosemary leaves
* 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
* 2 cups croutons (crumbled corn bread also does well in this recipe.)
* 1/2 cup water or broth

[[#directions]]
!!Directions

# Heat up the oven to 350{$DegF}.

# Cut the squash in half, scooping out the seeds. Then scoop out and save more of the squash to make room for stuffing.

# Heat oil/butter/spray in a pan over medium heat. When hot, put in the onions, celery and carrots, and cook until the onion turns translucent, a few minutes.

# Add in the chopped nuts, herbs, and reserved squash pulp and cook for a few more minutes, stirring occasionally.

# Add in the dry croutons, stir thoroughly, then add the water or broth. The stuffing should be moist, but not very wet.

# Stuff each half of the squash and place in a baking pan.

# Cover the whole pan with foil and bake for 45 minutes, or until the squash is soft (larger squash will take longer).

This is great alone, but even better with a sauce over the top. A light cheese sauce or a meat gravy such as turkey gravy will go very well on top of this.
