There are easy dry mixes for hollandaise that are every bit as good as this recipe, without the need for double boiling, and being attentive to it. I usually just use one of the mix packets and follow the directions on it.

[[#ingredients]]
!!Ingredients
* 4 egg yolks
* 3 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
* 1 pinch ground white pepper
* 1/8 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
* 1 tablespoon water
* 1 cup butter, melted
* 1/4 teaspoon salt

[[#directions]]
!!Directions
# Fill the bottom of a double boiler part-way with water. Make sure that water does not touch the top pan. Bring water to a gentle simmer.

# In the top of the double boiler, whisk together egg yolks, lemon juice, white pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and 1 tablespoon water.

# Add the melted butter to egg yolk mixture 1 or 2 tablespoons at a time while whisking yolks constantly.

# If hollandaise begins to get too thick, add a teaspoon or two of hot water.

# Continue whisking until all butter is incorporated.

# Whisk in salt, then remove from heat.

# Place a lid on pan to keep sauce warm until ready to serve.
