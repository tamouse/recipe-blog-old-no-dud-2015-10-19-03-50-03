I haven't actually tried this recipe yet, but I ''love'' me some pickles, so someday I will do this.

!!Ingredients

* 2 quarts cucumbers - peel and slice (use food processor for the slicing)
* Dill (1 head for bottom of bowl, 1 head for top)
* 1 onion, chopped (food processor again, FTW)
* 1 tablespoon salt
* 2 cups white sugar
* 1 cup vinegar (she doesn't specify what kind of vinegar here)
* 1 1/2 teaspoons celery seed

!!Directions
# Combine sliced cucumbers and onion in a bowl, pour salt over them. Let stand for a half hour.
# Drain off juice from cucumber and onion mixture.
# Place dill in the bottom of a bowl, put drained cucumber and onion mix in bowl, place the other dill on top.
# Mix sugar, vinegar and celery seed together until sugar is dissolved.
# Pour sugar and vinegar mix over all.
# Let stand 24 hours in refridgerator.
