!!Ingredients
(:comment bulleted list of ingredients, with notes if necessary:)
* 2 tablespoons oil [^original recipe called for 1/4 c. extra-virgin olive oil -- this is way too much for the reduced amount of potatoes^]

* 1/4 cup chopped red onion [^originally 1/2 cup^]
* a dash of  coarse salt [^original was 1/2 teaspoon^]
* 1/8 tsp. smoked paprika [^original was 1/2 teaspoon^]
* 1 broccoli top, cut into 1-in. pieces [^originally was 1 stalk (about 2 c.) - one top or head of a smallish broccoli head should do^]
* %color=grey%1/2 c. jarred piquillo peppers or roasted red pepper, drained, patted dry and chopped%% [^Omitted these for dietary reasons^]
* 4 eggs [^6 originally^]
* Freshly ground black pepper

!!Directions
# Heat the bottom of a frittata pan over medium heat until hot. Add oil. When oil is hot enough to sizzle a piece of potato, spread potatoes in pan. Cook potatoes, turning occasionally with a wide spatula, until they are evenly browned and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. Add onion and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. Sprinkle potatoes with salt and paprika.

# Meanwhile, bring medium saucepan half full of water to a boil. Add broccoli and cook, uncovered, for 3 minutes. Drain, rinse with cold water and shake dry. Add broccoli {-and peppers-} to frittata pan, distributing them evenly on top of potatoes.

# In small bowl, whisk the eggs, 2 tablespoons water and a grinding of black pepper until frothy. Pour eggs over vegetables. Sprinkle cheese on top.

# Cook over medium to medium-low heat, tilting pan to allow uncooked eggs in the center to run under the set eggs around the edges, for 5 minutes.

# Heat the top of the frittata pan and spray with cooking oil. When hot, put on top of bottom frittata pan and invert on burner. Cook until eggs are evenly set, 3 to 5 minutes more. Cut into wedges and serve directly from the pan.
