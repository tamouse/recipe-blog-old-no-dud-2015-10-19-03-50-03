# {-Stir cornstarch mixture and add to the skillet. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1-2 minutes or until thickened.-} Stir in hoisin sauce. Add coleslaw mix; stir to coat. {+Cook and stir for a few more minutes.+} {+Spread hoisin sauce on each tortilla.+} Spoon about 1/2 cup pork mixture into the center of each tortilla; roll up tightly.

!!Notes

I don't like to use thickeners in sauces, so I left out the cornstarch preparation. I also put the ginger in with the pork and garlic to let it cook and release more of it's flavours and permeate the dish. Next time, I think I'd grate some more carrots to go with the cole slaw mix. There just aren't enough in the mix. I'm also not a big fan of using oil to cook, so I  just spray the pan with Pam. 2 pork loin chops were more than enough for 3 people as well.
