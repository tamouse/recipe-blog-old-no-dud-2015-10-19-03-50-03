Don't know where I found this recipe, but it makes a great dip. Someone tried on their burger at a BBQ and declared it wonderful.

[[#ingredients]]
!!Ingredients

* 1/2 pound of bacon
* 1 large onion, chopped (vidalia or walla-walla are best in this)
* 3 large cloves garlic, minced
* 1.5 cups light mayo or miracle whip
* 8 ounces of crumbled blue cheese
* Ground black pepper to taste

[[#directions]]
!!Directions

# In a medium hot skillet, cook the bacon. ''(The easiest way I've found to do this is cut up the uncooked bacon into 2 inch strips and keep a good eye on it while it's cooking. Bacon is one of those things that can go from underdone to overdone in a moment. See [[MakingBaconBits|+]])''

# Remove the bacon from the pan and drain on paper towels.

# Add the onion and garlic to the bacon grease in the skillet and cook until the onion is translucent (or see [[#comment001|first comment]]). Drain and transfer to a bowl.

# Crumble the bacon and add to the bowl. 

# Add the mayo, blue cheese and pepper; mix thoroughly.

This is one of those recipes you have to play around with quantities to get it to the consistency you'd like. More/less mayo, more/less blue cheese, etc. More bacon? You bet! Less bacon? NO WAY!

I'm going to try this with carmelized onions sometime.

The recipe says to only cook the onions and garlic until
translucent. I think this recipe would be made awesomer and awesomer if you took the onions all the way to carmelized.
