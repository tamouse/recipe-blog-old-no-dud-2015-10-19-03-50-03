This is surprisingly simple and so delicious! I first had baked nachos from a little hole-in-the-wall burrito place in Santa Clara, whose name escapes me now. They had great burritos though, and this was what they made of nachos!


!! Ingredients

* 8 oz restaurant-style tortilla chips (Mission, Tostitos, etc)
* 2 oz cheddar cheese, grated
* 2 oz pepper jack cheese, grated
* 4 oz ground beef
* taco or fajita seasoning
* 1/2 small onion, chopped
* 1/2 cup salsa (to your taste) (or use pico de gallo)
* guacamole
* sour cream

!! Directions

# Pre-heat oven to 350{$DegF}.
# Brown the ground beef with the onions and the seasoning mix well. Drain.
# Place a doule layer of foil on a cooking tray, curling up the edges of the foil to form a leak barrier
# Spread the chips on the foil
# Layer the ground beef mixture onto the chips, spreading out so it covers well
# Layer the cheese on the beef and chips
# Place salsa around at various spots (you don't want to use too much or cover too heavily)
# Place in oven and bake for 15-20 minutes -- be careful not to let the chips burn!
# Serve with sour cream and guacamole for garnish'


!! Variations
* See SimpleNachos for a quickie version -- not as good, but ok for quick nacho emergencies!
* If you like jalapeños, feel free. Even better would be to go all the way to roasted jalapeños, aka chipolte.
* You can put in practically any sort of meat, seasoned properly: chicken (pollo), steak (carne asada), pork (carnitas). Or even leave out the meat entirely, cheese nachos bake up really well!
