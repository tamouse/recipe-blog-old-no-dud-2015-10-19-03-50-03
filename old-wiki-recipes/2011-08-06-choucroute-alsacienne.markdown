This is a traditional Alsacian recipe, rather simplified here, but oh so delicious

!!Ingredients
* 4-6 pork loin chops, boneless
* 1 pound of sauerkraut
* 4-6 medium potatoes
* 1-2 medium onions
* 1-2 medium apples
* 1/2 cup white wine (I usually use Gewertztrameiner or Reisling)
* salt and pepper
* carraway seeds

!!Directions
# Heat oven to 350°F
# Season pork chops with salt and pepper, both sides
# Peel and slice onion
# Slice apple
# Peel and cube potatoes
# Rinse and drain the sauerkraut. Mix in carroway seeds
# Sautée onion and apple for a few minutes in a pan
# Add pork chops and sear well on both sides
# In a dutch oven or covered casserole dish, put potatoes, onion, apple and pork chops in the bottom
# Put the sauerkraut over the top
# Pour in the wine
# Season to taste
# Cover and place in the oven for 50-60 minutes

!!Variations

This time I didn't have any carroway seeds, so instead I used sage, thyme and paprika as seasoning. If I'd had any rosemary, I'd have used that as well.

Jaques Pépin has a fantastic [[http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/choucroute-garnie|Choucroute Garnie]] recipe that involves using pork ribs, kielbasa sausage, skinless hot dogs and baked ham in the dish.
