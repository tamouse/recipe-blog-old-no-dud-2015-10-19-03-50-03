The standard GBC is pretty basic: couple of cans of green beans, can of mushroom soup, top with french fried onion strings. This retains only some of that, but makes it into something more than a quick toss together, with some substance.

[[#ingredients]]
!!Ingredients
* 1.5 pounds green beans
* 4 slices bacon
* 1 can mushrooms, drained
* 1/4 cup walnuts
* 4 ounces swiss cheese
* 1 can cream of mushroom soup[^Sometime, I'm going to do this with a regular white sauce and some other flavourings rather than use the tinned soup. This is not that year.^]
* fresh ground pepper, to taste
* 1 small can french fried onion strings


[[#directions]]
!!Directions
# heat oven to 350{$DegF}.
# wash, trim, and cut the green beans into 2 inch pieces.
# in a large pot, bring salted water to boil.
# parboil the green beans for 1 minute. drain and set aside.
# fry up the bacon, drain on paper towels, and crumble.
# chop the walnuts, not too fine.
# grate the swiss cheese.
# in a large bowl, combine beans, bacon, walnuts, drained mushrooms, swiss cheese, soup, ground pepper, and about half the can of onion strings.
# pour mixture into 1 1/2 quart casserole.
# bake at 350{$DegF} for about 25 minutes.
# stir the bean mixture, top with the remaining onion strings.
# continue baking for another 5-10 minutes until the onion strings are golden brown.
