!!Ingredients

* {-1 (2 to 3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces-} 6 chicken thighs, skin taken off
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* {-1 1/2 cups-} prepared barbecue sauce (just use enough to coat each piece). Our favourite BBQ sauce is Rudolph's, from a restaurant in the Twin Cities.

!!Directions

# Preheat oven to 350{$DegF} (175{$DegC}).

# Place chicken in a shallow baking dish {+lined with foil+} and sprinkle with garlic powder. Cover and bake {-1 hour-} {+45 minutes+}.

# Remove baking dish from oven and drain any fat from dish. {-Pour-}{+Brush+} the barbecue sauce evenly over the chicken and bake uncovered for {-30-} {+15-20+} minutes. 

# Remove and serve.

Makes 6 servings for us. Serve with HomeMadePotatoSalad and corn on the cob for a delicious summer meal.
