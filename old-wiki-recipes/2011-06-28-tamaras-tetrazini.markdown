Summary:I get asked to make this a lot. Before I knew what it was called, I called it "Wild Turkey Surprise." Now I know better and it's actually got some legitimacy to it.

The basic recipe here started with a recipe from a Sunset magazine cookbook, Favorite Recipes. I've modified since then.

!!Comments

When I'm making this for other people, which is often, I don't put in the thai chili sauce. I just do that for me. It makes things really pop.

!!Variations

I've heard that some recipes for tetrazini call for some kind of nuts, such as slivered almonds or something like that. I may have to try that, but I'm not sure at which stage to add them.
