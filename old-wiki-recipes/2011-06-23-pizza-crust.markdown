This recipe from my friends Cymru and Alaric is just like the recipe I used to have for pizza crust before I lost my recipe notebook. It's good to see it again!

[[#ingredients]]
!!Ingredients

* 2 cups all-purpose flour 
* 1 packet yeast (2¼ tsp) 
* ¾ cup hot water 
* ¼ cup oil 
* 1½ tsp salt 
* ½ tsp garlic powder 
* 1 tbsp Italian herbs 
* ½ tbsp Parmesan cheese 
* ¼ tsp black pepper 

[[#directions]]
!!Directions

# Mix all the dry ingredients together in a bowl.

# Add the liquids, stir until it starts to form a ball, scrape off the spoon, and knead in the rest of the flour by hand.

# Cover loosely and set aside to rise for 30 minutes.

# Roll out or toss to form into a crust.

# Top as desired, and bake at your oven's highest temperature for 10 minutes or until the cheese is browned on top.

# Allow to rest for 5-10 minutes before cutting. 

[[#Comments]]

This makes enough for one large pizza, and the crust should be firm enough to slide into your oven on a pizza peel (no pan required).  For best results, use a preheated pizza stone, or line the bottom of your oven with unglazed terracotta tiles (about $12 a box at your local builders' supply store). 



[[#variations]]
!!Variations

Try these variations: 

* Use olive oil flavored with basil, garlic, rosemary, or even jalapeño peppers. 

* Top your pizza with chopped chicken saut&eacute;ed in Thai Bangkok Padang peanut sauce. 

* Saut&eacute; chicken with Italian herbs, simmer in Alfredo sauce, and sprinkle with grated Stilton before baking. 

* The Customary Pizza:  Canadian bacon, mushrooms, pineapple, and sliced apple (pepperoni and blue cheese optional).
