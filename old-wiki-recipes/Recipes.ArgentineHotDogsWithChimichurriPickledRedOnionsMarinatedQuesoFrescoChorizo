Yes, chorizo on a hot dog. It&rsquo;s a hot dog elevated to a new level.%0a> %0a> I came across this recipe when I was reading the food section in our local newspaper. I made only a few changes. I thought these dogs deserved something better than your typical white hot dog bun, so we bought some soft steak rolls, cut them in half lengthwise and made a slit in each half, creating hot dog buns with some substance. I also went in a different direction with the pickled onions. The original recipe calls for pouring a simple syrup and grenadine over them, but since I didn&rsquo;t have any grenadine and didn&rsquo;t have a need for buying a whole bottle, I decided to just use my method for quick cucumber pickles (adding a little vinegar, agave nectar, and salt), but adding more agave nectar to make the onions sweeter, in order to counter-balance the acidity in the chimichurri. The chorizo adds the perfect amount of spice, and the marinated queso fresco adds a cooling, creamy counterpoint. See why this hot dog is in a different dimension?%0a> %0a> https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-u6_LG05Jl1c/TlXVYwSIEQI/AAAAAAAADHw/NbWiTHg0GDs/s400/16%252520months%2525202.jpg \\%0a> Levi especially enjoyed these hot dogs. I wish we had taken a picture, but his plate contained a de-constructed version of an Argentine hot dog. The pieces of hot dog and queso fresco disappeared first, but he seemed to enjoy all the components of this meal!%0a> %0a> The pickled onions and the marinated queso fresco are made the night before, and the chimichurri can be made the morning of, so everything comes together quickly at dinner time. All you have to do is cook the chorizo, grill the hot dogs, and assemble! Make these Argentine hot dogs while the grill is still out. Quick! Summer is fleeting.%0a> %0a> !!! https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-T_t1cB-3hVo/TlVlmzczZ5I/AAAAAAAADHc/a2CsmUSWGWs/s400/argentine%252520hot%252520dog%2525203.jpg \\ Argentine Hot Dogs%0a> %0a52c77,79%0a%3c %0a---%0a> https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Hfl21HyrRoo/TlVlop5P0YI/AAAAAAAADHk/09pfWEkYavA/s400/argentine%252520hot%252520dog%252520toppings.jpg \\%0a> Wow &ndash; that&rsquo;s a long list of ingredients, I know!

Argentine Hot Dogs (with Chimichurri, Pickled Red Onions, Marinated Queso Fresco &amp;&nbsp;Chorizo)%0a%3c %0a%3c August 24, 2011 by [[http://oishiifood.wordpress.com/author/briannalark/ | Brianna]]%0a%3c %0a%3c https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-oWg7pUAVCMA/TlVllfiN0JI/AAAAAAAADHY/Gij2iiuf2xg/s400/argentine%252520hot%252520dog%2525202.jpg \\%0a%3c It&rsquo;s nearing the end of summer, and you&rsquo;ve probably had your share of hot dogs, but these Argentine dogs are as far from yellow mustard and ketchup as you can get.&nbsp; Grilled all-beef hot dogs get an array of colorful and flavorful toppings: a verdant chimichurri with the addition of finely chopped sweet red and yellow peppers and grated carrot, sweet and tangy pickled red onions, queso fresco marinated in olive oil and yellow flecks of lemon zest, and spicy ground chorizo. Yes, chorizo on a hot dog. It&rsquo;s a hot dog elevated to a new level.%0a%3c %0a%3c I came across this recipe when I was reading the food section in our local newspaper. I made only a few changes. I thought these dogs deserved something better than your typical white hot dog bun, so we bought some soft steak rolls, cut them in half lengthwise and made a slit in each half, creating hot dog buns with some substance. I also went in a different direction with the pickled onions. The original recipe calls for pouring a simple syrup and grenadine over them, but since I didn&rsquo;t have any grenadine and didn&rsquo;t have a need for buying a whole bottle, I decided to just use my method for quick cucumber pickles (adding a little vinegar, agave nectar, and salt), but adding more agave nectar to make the onions sweeter, in order to counter-balance the acidity in the chimichurri. The chorizo adds the perfect amount of spice, and the marinated queso fresco adds a cooling, creamy counterpoint. See why this hot dog is in a different dimension?%0a%3c %0a%3c https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-u6_LG05Jl1c/TlXVYwSIEQI/AAAAAAAADHw/NbWiTHg0GDs/s400/16%252520months%2525202.jpg \\%0a%3c Levi especially enjoyed these hot dogs. I wish we had taken a picture, but his plate contained a de-constructed version of an Argentine hot dog. The pieces of hot dog and queso fresco disappeared first, but he seemed to enjoy all the components of this meal!%0a%3c %0a%3c The pickled onions and the marinated queso fresco are made the night before, and the chimichurri can be made the morning of, so everything comes together quickly at dinner time. All you have to do is cook the chorizo, grill the hot dogs, and assemble! Make these Argentine hot dogs while the grill is still out. Quick! Summer is fleeting.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!! https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-T_t1cB-3hVo/TlVlmzczZ5I/AAAAAAAADHc/a2CsmUSWGWs/s400/argentine%252520hot%252520dog%2525203.jpg \\ Argentine Hot Dogs%0a%3c %0a%3c (Slightly adapted from the [[http://www.mercurynews.com/recipes/ci_18685935 | San Jose Mercury News]], original recipe by Carole Wendling; Serves 2)%0a%3c %0a%3c '''For the Chimichurri:'''%0a%3c %0a%3c 1/2 a bunch of parsley, chopped \\%0a%3c 1/4 cup olive oil \\%0a%3c Juice of 1 small lemon \\%0a%3c 1 TBS. red wine vinegar \\%0a%3c 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes \\%0a%3c 1/4 tsp. crushed garlic \\%0a%3c 1/4 cup finely diced red and yellow peppers \\%0a%3c 2 tablespoons grated carrot%0a%3c %0a%3c '''For the Pickled Red Onions:'''%0a%3c %0a%3c 1/2 red onion, sliced \\%0a%3c 2 TBS. white wine vinegar (or champagne vinegar) \\%0a%3c agave nectar to taste \\%0a%3c Kosher salt to taste%0a%3c %0a%3c '''For the Marinated Queso Fresco:'''%0a%3c %0a%3c 4 ounces queso fresco, crumbled \\%0a%3c 2 tablespoons olive oil \\%0a%3c 1/4 teaspoon crushed garlic \\%0a%3c Zest from 1/2 lemon \\%0a%3c Salt, pepper to taste%0a%3c %0a%3c '''To Assemble:'''%0a%3c %0a%3c 2 grilled beef hot dogs \\%0a%3c 1 sweet or sour steak roll &ndash; cut in half lengthwise, with a slit cut into each half to form 2 hot dog &ldquo;buns&rdquo; \\%0a%3c 4 ounces ground chorizo, cooked%0a%3c %0a%3c https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Hfl21HyrRoo/TlVlop5P0YI/AAAAAAAADHk/09pfWEkYavA/s400/argentine%252520hot%252520dog%252520toppings.jpg \\%0a%3c Wow &ndash; that&rsquo;s a long list of ingredients, I know!
