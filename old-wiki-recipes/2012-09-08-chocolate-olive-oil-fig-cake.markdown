# Brush a 6-cup muffin pan with olive oil and dust with flour.

# Whisk the cocao powder and &frac14; cup hot water in a small bowl; let cool slightly.

# Combine the flour, salt and baking soda in another bowl.

# Combine the sugar, egg and egg yolk, vanilla, and lemon zest in a stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment and beat on medium-high speed until pale and thick, about 1 minute.

# With the mixer running, drizzle in the olive oil.

# Add the cocoa mixture and beat until combined.

# Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the flour mixture and beat until just incorporated.

# Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups.
