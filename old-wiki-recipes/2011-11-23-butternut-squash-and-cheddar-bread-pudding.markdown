[[#ingredients]]
!!Ingredients
* 2 pound peeled, seeded butternut squash, cut into 3/4 inch cubes
* 3 tablespoon olive oil, divided
* Kosher salt
* 7 eggs
* 2.25 cups half-and-half
* 6 tablespoons dry white wine
* 1.5 tablespoon dijon mustard
* 1 day old bagette (do not remove crusts!) torn into 1 inch pieces
* 1 cup chopped shallots
* 1 bunch kale, ribs removed, kale chopped coarsely
* 8 ounces extra sharp cheddar cheese, grated

[[#directions]]
!!Directions
# Heat oven to 400{$DegF}.
# Toss squash with 1 tablespoon olive oil on rimmed baking sheet.
# Sprinkle with coarse salt.
# Bake until squash is tender, turning occasionally with spatula, about 20 to 25 minutes.

# Whisk eggs in a large bowl.
# Add half-and-half, wine, mustard, and 1.5 teaspoons coarse salt.
# Whisk to blend.
# Add baguette pieces, fold gently into egg mixture.
# Let soak 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

# Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.
# Add shallots and sauté until soft, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.
# Add kale; cover and cook 2 minutes.
# Uncover and stir until kale is wilted but still bright green, about 5 minutes (kale will be a bit crunchy).

# Reduce oven temp to 350{$DegF}. Generously butter a 9x13 baking dish.

# Using a slotted spoon, transfer half of bread from egg mixture to prepared baking dish, arranging to cover most of the dish.
# Spoon half of kale mixture over bread.
# Sprinkle with half of cheese.
# Repeat with remaining bread, kale mixture, and cheese.
# Pour remaining egg mixture over bread pudding.

# Cover bread pudding with foil.
# Bake at 350{$DegF} for 20 minutes.
# Remove foil.
# Bake uncovered until custard is set and bread feels springy to touch, about 20 more minutes.

# Preheat broiler.
# Broil bread pudding until cheese browns slightly, about 2 minutes.
# Cool 5 minutes before cutting.
