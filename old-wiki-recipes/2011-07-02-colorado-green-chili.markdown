Like it's cousin, ColoradoRedChili, this recipe came from a friend of mine out in Colorado who goes by the handle Fielding Melish.
This is a green variety of chili, a chili verde. Note that the "Colorado" in the title doesn't mean the Spanish word for "red" -- it's where the recipe originated.

!!Ingredients
* 2 lb pork roast
* 4-6 tomatillos (little green tomatoes)
* 1 onion, chopped
* 1 cup of water (or use beer)
* 1 chopped habañero (cf WorkingWithPeppers)
* Cumin, chili powder, salt and pepper to taste

!!Directions
# Put onion in bottom of crockpot
# Wash roast and place in crockpot
# Chop and seed the tomatillos and add to crockpot
# Add water (or beer) to crockpot
# Cook on low for 7-8 hours
# Remove roast from cooker and shred, returning meat to crockpot
# Add habañero and spices, cook an additional 1-2 hours

Serve in bowls with shredded cheese, or in warm tortillas with shredded cheese and lettuce, and salsa, sour cream and/or guac as toppers.

!!Variations

Some people like to add beans to chili. This mostly works as is, but you can always add:
* kidney beans
* pinto beans
* black beans (Probably the best)
